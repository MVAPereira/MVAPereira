### Hey you 👋

### 🥸 About me: 

-  👨🏻‍🎓 I have a master's degree in software engineering, during which I worked mainly with database migration and React.
-  🧑🏻‍💼 My main professional work experience has been in backend development, but since then, I've also had contact with many frontend technologies.
-  💻 I'm a big fan of programming to solve real-world problems, and I'm especially interested in databases and data structures.
-  🥨 In addition, I'm very interested in language learning. Currently, I'm working on improving my German.
